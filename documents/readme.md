This is a short explainer of the rationale and process behind this project.

# The idea for the project

In 1997, I started to research drug use and dealing among south Asian communities in England for Radio 4's World This Weekend.
Then in 2003, I presented two programmes for File on 4, the BBC's flagship investigative radio journalism programme.
In 2020, I wanted to explore what had changed in a generation.

# The process

FOI requests to eight forces with high south Asian populations.

FOI request to Ministry of Justice to see how many in jail with an ethnic breakdown.

Clean up data as necessary.
Decide what the data from each force tells you. 
Decide common factors.
Interrogate data by using pivot tables.
Decide the story. 

Interview protagnonists - case studies, experts and those in authority.
If you want to make a campaign, decide early on who might help you e.g. MPs and influencers.

Give the police and Home Office the right to respond.

Write story. What are the angles? What is significant? What makes this story stand out? What elements do you need to tell?

Edit video/audio.

Create visuals.

Put online.

# The evidence

The excel sheets and FOI responses show how drug dealing and offending have changed in a generation.

It is clear that neither the police nor the Home Office look at this issue through the ethnicity lens.

# The follow up

With Covid it would be interesting to see what has changed in 2019-2020. 
Also, I will be sending my evidence and suggestions to MPs and the Home Affairs Select Committee.
